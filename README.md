### ✨ Projects I’m Proud Of

- 🚀 [**Zaera – Peace over Pennies**]

**My startup. My vision. My solution.**
A mobile-first expense-sharing app I founded to bring clarity and peace to shared living. It simplifies the stress, confusion, and awkward conversations that come with splitting bills among roommates or friends.

💡 Built from my own experience living in hostels, Zaera is more than just an app — it’s the first product from my startup journey as a solo founder, designer, and developer.

📲 Core Features:

Create & manage shared Groups (like “Flat #302” or “Trip to Skardu”)

Add detailed Expenses with notes & receipts

Smart, customizable bill splitting (equal, %, custom)

Real-time "who owes who" ledger 

Settle Up via cash or online

Friendly reminders so you never need to awkwardly chase payments

Built in Flutter with ❤️


- 💡 [**InfoKlub**] 
 A modern platform for Bangladeshi users to organize their education, skills, health & employment data. Uses AI to generate professional CVs with real-time data sync.


- 💡 [**Kiosk Software – Lease Agreement**] 
 A self-service desktop kiosk app that allows users to fill digital lease forms, sign electronically, scan their ID, and instantly print the final agreement — streamlining the full process without needing staff involvement.


- 🔒 [**Smart Helmet – Accident Detection System**]
 Flutter + IoT integrated helmet app that detects sudden impact or falls and sends alerts in emergencies. Designed for bikers’ safety.🚴‍♂️
