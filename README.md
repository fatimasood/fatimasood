# Hi there, I'm Fatima 👋 

### 🚀 AI Research Student | Explainable AI (XAI)
**Bridging the gap between High-Performance Deep Learning and Clinical Trust.**

Currently pursuing my **Master’s in Artificial Intelligence**, specializing in making medical AI transparent and interpretable. Former **Flutter Developer** with a "production-first" mindset.

### 🧠 Research Focus: "Beyond the Black Box"
I develop interpretable frameworks for high-stakes medical diagnostics:
* **Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD):** Utilizing XAI to identify early-stage biomarkers.
* **Chronic Disease (Diabetes):** Enhancing predictive trust using feature attribution methods.
* **Mission:** Building AI that doctors can understand and trust.
